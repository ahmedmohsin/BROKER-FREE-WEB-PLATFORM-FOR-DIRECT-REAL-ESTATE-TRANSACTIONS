## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

LARAVEL
COMPOSER
PHP


## IMPOTANT NOTE

First, make sure you have Composer installed on your system. For Laravel projects, PHP Version 7 or higher is required as older versions are not compatible with Composer. As a result, you’ll need to manage your PHP version (only if you’re using the old version) at the moment.

## Instructions: How to Run?

•	After you finish downloading the project, unzip the project file.
•	Open the project folder, check for the env file, and update the database credentials as needed (DB name, username, password)
•	Create a MySQL database with the name defined in the env file.
•	Then, open the project in the Terminal or Command Prompt.
•	Install the composer dependencies: composer install
•	For the database, you can run the migration files to create a new one following the command lines.
•	Migrate the tables: php artisan migrate
•	Run seeder: php artisan db:seed
•	Then generate the key: php artisan key:generate
•	Create a symbolic link to the storage folder: php artisan storage:link
•	And finally, run the project: php artisan serve
•	It will start the application and give you a URL.
•	At last, open the URL in your preferred browser; we recommend using Google Chrome for the best performance.
•	All the login details are provided in the text files inside the project folder. Check them and enter them to use it.
